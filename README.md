# Project 2 - Interactive Full-Stack Application

Collaborating within a group to create an interactive Full-Stack Application. Do you love food? Do you like posting on the internet? What if I told you that you can do both? The Rolling Scones is a site where you can post all of the food you want. Recipes and reviews of food from restaurants, home and that one thing you ate that one time. Itâ€™s all here.

## Description
