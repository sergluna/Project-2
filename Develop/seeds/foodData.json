        "food_descr": "To say that the margherita pizza is a classic pizza is an understatement. This is THE pizza. The archetype for all pizza. The recipe for this is simple and easy. 1 24oz can of San Marzano tomatoes (take out of can, peel off skins and cut tops off. You then squeeze them to death and that's your sauce). 12oz of FRESH mozzarella. About 6 basil leaves. Or however many you want, doesn't matter to me! Some olive oil. Pizza dough. Now, you could make the dough from scratch, but do you really have the time for that? You probably do, but you're just too lazy. I know you. Now, assemble all ingredients (it should be pretty obvious how). Throw that in your oven that's on the broiler setting. You're gonna want that oven HOT. Pull it out in about 7 minutes, or when that cheese is melted and that dough is looking almost burnt. top with some olive oil, cut into slices, and you are set to go! This recipe makes a couple za's. Enjoy.",

        "food_descr": "Now. I love burgers. You love burgers. Everyone loves burgers. Your ingredients for this burger are also follows: 2lb ground beef (i prefer 70/30 but 80/20 is fine). About 8 slices of classic American cheese. 8 burger buns. 1 head of lettuce. 1 onion. Mustard, ketchup. Jar of pickles. Easy, simple recipe. Turn those 2lbs of beef into 8 1/4lb balls. Throw them suckers on the grill, smash them down, and cook for a couple minutes on 1 side. Flip em, put american cheese on em, and let cook for a couple more minutes. While that's happening, throw some buns on the grill and let em toast a bit. When it's all said and done, take em off the grill and assemble however way you want. Lettuce, onions, mustard, ketchup. What else does a guy need? Tomatoes? Pickles? NO. NONE OF THAT HERE. This recipe makes 8 burgers. Enjoy.",

        "food_descr": "Why are you spending $5 on a small bottle of simple syrup when it's so easy and cheap to make? It's because you're an idiot. But do not worry! I am here to help. All you need is 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water. Heat up pot with ingredients and stir around a bit as it heats. It's done when the sugar has disappeared completely. Then just pour into your favorite bottle for storage. See that's why they call it SIMPLE syrup. You can make it a rich syrup by making it 2 parts sugar to one part water. A semi-rich syrup is 1.5 parts sugar to 1 part water.",

He was DYING. He did love it though. We both did. There were so many meats and veg and noodles we were throwing in there that i don't even remember the name of but it was SO GOOD. It was a bit pricey at $25 a person (there were even higher prices for better cuts of meat), but it was well worth it. I cannot stop thinking of this place. It's the love of my life. Husband, who? All i can think of is hot pot. Hot pot. Hot pot. Hot pot.",
